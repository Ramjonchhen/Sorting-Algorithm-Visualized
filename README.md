# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualization
This project visualizes two sorting algorithms **Bubble Sort** and **Selection Sort** on given user input. User must give no of inputs (maximum 9 for the project) and give the inputs for the visualization.

## How to Use this app:-

### Setting Up The Environment
1. Download and install 
[Code::Blocks](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/17.12/Windows/codeblocks-17.12mingw-setup.exe/download) for running this project.
1. Setup Graphics in Code::Blocks [Click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SnhzqNg5cn7Bgsnqh9I5W6DjxRmmqzW7/view?usp=sharing)
1. After installing Code::Blocks, and setupping the graphics in Code::Blocks open this repo as an project in Code::Blocks.

### Visualizing The Algorithms:-
1. Compile and run the project.
2. Two windows will appear, one window for visualizing the algorithms and one for the input.
3. First we need to give input and choose sorting algorithm so first select the input window.
3. Select among the Bubble Sort and Selection Sort for visualiztion.
3. Then give input in the input window. Give no of inputs (max 9) and give respective inputs.
4. Then go to the visual window where we can see the visuals.
5. Press enter for the visualization to begin.
